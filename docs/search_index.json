[["index.html", "Human Islets Chapter 1 General Introduction", " Human Islets 2023-12-22 Chapter 1 General Introduction The HumanIslets tool houses data collected from or associated with human islets procured by the University of Alberta. The data includes clinical metadata I envision a branching timeline, so that you can visualize everything that happened to an islet sample prior to the collection of each data type. Here is a rough outline of steps (I know it’s incomplete/wrong - will look at some of the guides on the IsletCore website to better sketch out) Pancreas procurement Shipping to Edmonton Islet isolation (more details here - I assume many/multiple steps) GSIS outcomes Other outcomes at UofA Shipping to other labs for seahorse, perifusion, omics Shipping to other labs (not in project) "],["overview-of-metadata-types.html", "Chapter 2 Overview of Metadata Types 2.1 Donor Characteristics: 2.2 Organ Characteristics and Processing: 2.3 Isolation Outcomes: 2.4 Cell Culture Outcomes: 2.5 Static Insulin Secretion: 2.6 Islet Oxygen Consumption (Seahorse assay): 2.7 Dynamic Insulin Responses to Macronutrients: 2.8 Single-cell Function (electrophysiology)", " Chapter 2 Overview of Metadata Types For each outcome type, include information on: Overview of experimental procedures performed prior to collecting the data (and relevant technical parameters) -&gt; refer to timeline diagram Glossary of every variable in the tool: what precisely does it mean, what are the units, etc Who collected the data (institution) Replicates - were there any, are they different groups of islets, different individual cells, etc Explanation of any changes in protocols (ie. switch to different GSIS concentrations, maybe different platform used halfway through, etc) Whether data was intentionally collected on specific subsets of donors Versions of data available for download Data processing prior to statistical analysis (merging replicates, transformations, removed outliers, definition of any computed/normalized values) Any additional notes Citations of papers that have published parts of the data 2.1 Donor Characteristics: Donor characteristics are provided to the Isletcore team through the organ procurement programs. These characteristics can come from the family and aren’t always accurate reflections of the medical history. Hba1c measurements are performed in the Isletcore when the donor blood sample is available. 2.2 Organ Characteristics and Processing: Organ characteristic and processing data is recorded during the islet isolation by the lead technician. Cold Ischemia time will be calculated based on the cross clamp time during organ procurement until the start of the isolation in Edmonton. 2.3 Isolation Outcomes: Islet purity, IEQ, % trapped, IPI are determined by the lead technician. Full details on determining IEQ, purity etc can be found here or in our IsletCore welcome booklet. Details on determining Insulin and DNA samples can always be found here. Cell proportion data is determined through our proteomics data. Proteomics samples are shipped to Jim Johnson’s lab at UBC. Samples are then hand picked and snap frozen for processing. 2.4 Cell Culture Outcomes: On the day of shipping, Islets are recounted to determine IEQ, % recovery, IPI after culture. Culture time is determined by the end of the isolation until approximately 9am on a shipping day. Post culture samples are collected for insulin and DNA as previously described. 2.5 Static Insulin Secretion: In triplicates, 15 hand picked islets from each donor were sequentially treated with low glucose for 1 hour followed by high glucose 1 hour. Collected supernatant for low glucose, high glucose or insulin content are measured by ELISA and recorded in the database. For each donor, there are multiple glucose combinations that may have been used. Glucose pairs are 1mM to 10mM glucose, 1mM to 16.7mM glucose or 2.8mM glucose to 16.7mM glucose. Islets used in the 1mM to 10mM group are unique from the 1mM to 16.7mM group. The secretion data are commonly presented as a percentage of the total content (secreted insulin/total insulin *100), and as a stimulation index (high glucose secretion/low glucose secretion). Biological outliers were defined as “Seth is coming up with the definition now”, and identified outliers were removed from the dataset. The data for each replicate (after outlier removal) can be downloaded from the data export page. The total insulin content, secretion percentages, and stimulation indices, averaged across replicates, can be queried, analyzed, and visualized in the other parts of the tool. Complete experimental details can be found here. 2.6 Islet Oxygen Consumption (Seahorse assay): 2.7 Dynamic Insulin Responses to Macronutrients: Human islets are shipped to Jim Johnson’s lab at UBC. Islets are hand picked and cultured in RPMI for 24-72hrs before the experiment to allow the islets to recover from shipping. 65 islets are loaded per chamber and pre-incubated for 1 hour. Islets are stimulated with 6 or 15mM glucose, 5mM Leucine or 0.75mM Oleic acid/0.75mM palmitic acid as indicated. Samples are stored at -20C until analysis with RIA. Full details are described here. 2.8 Single-cell Function (electrophysiology) Human islets are hand picked and dispersed into single cells and plated on 35mm cell culture dishes by the MacDonald lab. 24-72 hours after the dispersion, electrophysiological measurements are recorded. Cell identity is confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

[Include information on batches]. Raw reads were aligned to the [BLANK GENOME] using [BLANK SOFTWARE version BLANK]. The counts matrix was filtered to remove any genes with fewer than [X] mean counts. The counts were normalized for sequencing depth and adjusted to account for high variance/high abundant genes using the [BLANK] method in the limma voom R package (version #). Batch effect was corrected using the Combat-Seq R package (version #). Since 3.2 Gene expression (Nanostring) 50 islets are hand picked in Edmonton. Cells are washed with PBS then collected in 100ul of RLT Beta-mercaptoethanol. Islets arestored at -80C before shipping to the Lynn Lab. 3.3 Protein expression (proteomics) Human islets are shipped to Jim Johnson’s lab at UBC. 300 Islets are hand picked, washed with pbs and pellet is snap frozen and stored at -80C. Details of lysis and analysis are found here. 3.4 Gene expression (single-cell RNA-seq) 3.5 Gene expression (pseudobulk RNA-seq) 150 islets are hand picked at the University of Alberta and transferred into a tube with 1ml of Trizol reagent. Samples are stored at -80C until shipping to Anna Gloyn’s lab (originally Oxford now Stanford).
